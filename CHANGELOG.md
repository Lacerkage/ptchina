### 0.3.4

### 0.3.3
  - Minor bugfix to filenames of expanded images being incorrectly truncated in some circumstances, when "image loading bars" is enabled.

### 0.3.2
  - Minor bugfix to post moving.

### 0.3.1
  - Small board list optimisation, no longer try to fetch webring site names if webring not enabled.
  - Make webring blacklisting also apply to endpoints after being fetched, in case the URL is different (alt domain, onions, etc).
  - Webring.json and site names cache is now removed when webring is disabled.

  - Webring bugfixes.

### 0.3.0
  - Ban durations are now editable. Staff can set a new ban duration (starting from the current date, not the original ban issue date).
  - Minor bugfixes.

### 0.2.0
  - From now on, versioning = major.minor.patch. significant changes = major, feature updates = minor, bugfixes/small stuff = patch.
  - Update instructions about nginx changes when upgrading.
  - Add an endpoint for getting the csrf token separately from html pages. See API docs for more details.
  - Add post "marking" so moved/deleted posts info is sent over websocket. Frontend will handle them. Deleted threads and moved OPs will now also disconnect the socket and remove the post form.
  - Block bypasses are now locked to where they were created (anonymizer or clearnet) to prevent some forms of 'smuggling'. This will be improved further in upcoming releases.
  - Code highlighting now supports all highlight.js languages when explicitly specified. The whitelist now only applies to auto-detection, as originally intended.
  - Quotes for post references in modlog now have the proper quote class, and will show when hovered like any other quote.
  - Bugfixes
  - [jschan-docs](http://fatchan.gitgud.site/jschan-docs/):
    - API docs improvements, now includes csrf token, posting, post actions (and mod variants), and more. It should be enough documentation for somebody to write a mobile app integration.
  - [globalafk](https://gitgud.io/fatchan/globalafk/) (my fork):
    - On android with termux, tapping the notification will open the post (in mod view) and the notification has new shortcut buttons to quickly delete, delete+ban or delete+global ban.
